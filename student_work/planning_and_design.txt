Part I: Planning & Design (15 pts)

* Decide on a game idea and core goal
* Game rules and player actions are written or sketched out
* Main objects (player, obstacles, goals, enemies, etc.) are identified
* Sketch a simple plan showing how the game will work step-by-step
* Identify which icons you are going to use and get the unicode for those icons
* Determine your board size
* Determine your scoring system
* Determine win / lose conditions
* Outline expansion ideas

Game Idea:
Player is in a 7x7 area with the outer ring being a set of faces that fire lasers. The remaining 5x5 area will be used to dodge the 
lasers by hiding behind rocks that are generated in the room.

Game Rules:
The player must hide behind rocks to avoid being hit by lasers. If they are hit, they lose. As the player survives, the lasers will
fire more frequently making it more difficult to stay alive.

Scoring:
After each laser blast that the player survives, they get a point.
