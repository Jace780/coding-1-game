Part I: Planning & Design (15 pts)

* Decide on a game idea and core goal
* Game rules and player actions are written or sketched out
* Main objects (player, obstacles, goals, enemies, etc.) are identified
* Sketch a simple plan showing how the game will work step-by-step
* Identify which icons you are going to use and get the unicode for those icons
* Determine your board size
* Determine your scoring system
* Determine win / lose conditions
* Outline expansion ideas

Rant:
# cool_game
#game is bossfight, split into 3 phases. Between each phase player can upgrade himself. each phase introduces 1 new attack, and deals p #damage, where p is phase. so phase 1 has 1 attack and does 1 damage, phase 2 has 2 attacks and does 2 damage, etc.

#attak ideas: radius of bullets, lazers, and spike attack.

for rooms, imma premake like six, and assign each a ID(probably variable via letters A-F),and  chuck them into a list. The player will randomly generate a room from the list when they leave the room. 

player will start with 5 health
    this way player will have to either upgrade health to be tanky, OR damge to be strong. Doing both will lead to failure, because I love the idea of jack of all trades master of none. 

gear stats will be the following eqution: B+P(xU), or base + phase x upgrade

enemies stats for f(x)=(bxP)+S, or then enemies will be g(x)=b+p +S

melee, a ranged, support. 

should heal affect all entities, or select entities in range? 

melee: runs towards u, and swings. hp = f(x), damage b g(x)

Ranged: runs away from you, and fires 1 arrow every 3 seconds. hp = g(x), dmg=f(x)

Support: every 2 seconds will either heal 1 nearby ally by 5 points, Supports will perma have Php. 

after each boss phase, the boss will leave, and the player will be allowed to upgrade 1 of 2 things:
Health, Upgrade 
if Health is upgraded, you full heal. if already full healh, u gain 1 more max health
if upgrade is upgraded all U varaibles are increased by 1. 

Boss:
Health will be created so P1 is very difficult, P2 is somewhat difficult, and P3 is easy. 

boss damage will be P+ATK#

structure for jackson:

Goal: Beat the Boss.
Win: beat it's third phase
Loose: Die.

6x6, might change to 7x7 of tpp sa
